# Function Key Swap
To make your function keys work like "real" function keys, enter the computer's BIOS (press F2 on restart) and Disable the HotKey option.  This forces you to press the Fn key to change your speaker volume, however executing F5 works with one key press (versus two).

# Boilerplate
The term boilerplate refers to standardized text, copy, documents, methods, or procedures that may be used over again without making major changes to the original. A boilerplate is commonly used for efficiency and to increase standardization in the structure and language.

We can copy and paste the python data access code and treat it like boilerplate code, resuse it for our purposes.

# Insert Notes

# Writing Data Access Code in Python
- Write SQL using MySQLWorkbench (Make sure this is working and all good)
- Copy SQL into Python and add %s
- Execute Python code
- Check tables using MySQLWorkbench (Are we good?  Yes, move on...)
