Cron, Security

# Project Thoughts
- Do not freak out
- You have everything you need to build it
- How do you solve a big problem?  Break it up into smaller managable problems.
- Divide the work (divide and conquer)
- ProTip: Setup your infrastructure & foundation first (make sure you can actually do the work)
  - Make sure you can connect to DB
  - Access to repo
  - Make sure your computer works!

# CRON Jobs & Terminal Windows
- We can run cron jobs in separate terminal windows
- We can only run one debug session
- We can split terminal windows and all sorts of other options

# Forever 
- [Install Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install Forever: `npm install -g forever`
- Commands: 
 - List all Forever processes: `forever list`
 - Stop all processess: `forever stopall`
 - Start Forever process: `forever start -c python your_python_script.py`

# Python Control Logic
```
  age = 11
  name = 'marty'

  # Option #1
  if name == 'marty':
    print('marty was here')

  # Option #2
  if name == 'marty':
    print('marty was here')
  else:
    print('not marty')

  # Option #3:
  if age <=10:
    print('young')
  elif age > 10 and age <= 20:
    print('medium')
  elif age > 20:
    print('old')
```

# Strings (F-String & Escape Chars)
- [Escape Chars](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_escape_characters.asp)
```
  age = 51
  name = 'Marty'

  myString = f'My name is: {name} my age is: {age}.'    # String interpolation: Injecting variables into our string.
  myString2 = f'My name is: {name} \nMy age is: {age}.' # \ is an escape character and it allows us to do special things like new lines, and tabs.
  myString3 = f'My name is: {name} \tMy age is: {age}.' 
  print(myString3)
```

# AWS Security Group
- [What is my IP](https://mxtoolbox.com/whatismyip/)
- Aurora DB: Has one to many security groups associated with it
- 0.0.0.0/0 means all/any IP
- CIDR: 
  - 13.252.6.252/32 ==> one IP address
  - 13.252.6.252/24 ==> ~255 IP addressess (some are reserved) 
- Update AWS Security Group to allow access
