# Project Thoughts
- Do not freak out
- You have everything you need to build it
- How do you solve a big problem?  Break it up into smaller managable problems.
- Divide the work (divide and conquer)
- ProTip: Setup your infrastructure & foundation first (make sure you can actually do the work)
  - Make sure you can connect to DB
  - Access to repo
  - Make sure your computer works!
